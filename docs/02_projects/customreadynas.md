# Custom ReadyNAS NV+


## Background/Preface:
I purchased this Netgear RND4000 ReadyNAS NV+ with a failed PSU for a low price.
The intended use for this is to be a NAS that will live at my parents home to backup family photos and potentially provide storage for their other media.
Looking back, I should of just shelled out the money and bought a Synology or QNAP unit.


## Original Specs[^1]:
- 4 x 3.5" Hot Swap Drive Bays (SATA and SATA II)
- SPARC single-core processor
- 256 MB  PC2700 DDR-SDRAM SO-DIMM
- 1x Gigabit Ethernet Port
- 3x USB 2.0 Ports
- 12V 5A (60W) PSU
- 200 x 132 x 222 mm (HWD) 




## Plans:
My initial thoughts of adding a Mini-ITX board won't work as they are 170x170 mm.
Nano-ITX, Pico-ITX or an odd proprietary form factor will be the next cheapest and easiest move.
