# First Homebuilt High Vacuum System

## Background/Preface:
This project was started in 2021 as part of a uni research project.
I no longer have the paper I wrote for this, but I have the images and assorted info.
Looking back at this project, there are lots of things I would do differently. I intend to make these changes when I get time/space to do version 2.
I have made notes in all the sections with my comments on things I would change and opinions.


## Initial Scope:
To design and build a vacuum chamber capable of vacuum deposition for under $2000 AUD 


## Pump:
I used a Varian DS302 Dual Stage Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump.
I got this pump very cheap locally through eBay. I had no issues with it but I needed more than just a roughing pump to get the results I was wanting.

I intend to build a Titanium Sublimation Pump for version 2, Preferably as an add-on.


## Chamber:
The vessel was built from 316L 200NB (8") Seamless Pipe with ANSI 150# Flat Face Slip On Flanges Welded to each end. 
The FFSO flanges were welded to the seamless pipe, It is only welded on the inner side. Then the o-ring grooves were machined. I put some high grit sandpaper on a piece of glass to ensure a completely flat surface and then sanded the mating face to ensure no high spots remained from the welding. 
Both Ends were sealed with ANSI 150# 200NB Blind Flanges. Each of these had 4 holes drilled through, two of these are for KF-25 Flange Stubs to be welded into. The other holes were tapped as 1/4 NPT and M14x1.5.
The same process for welding and flattening was done for the KF-25 flange stubs.


The thickness of all of this is well and truly overkill. But the materials were chosen due to relatively low cost and availability. The weight of this makes working with it less than easy, each blind flange is nearly 20 kg!
If I was to use this design again, I would probably get something like 10mm plate laser cut.
