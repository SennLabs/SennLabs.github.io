# NA MX5/Miata V6

## Background/Preface:
I purchased this vehicle with the swap already "complete". The car ran and drove but had tonnes of issues.


## Current Specs:
- 1993 Eunos Roadster (Mazda NA Miata/MX5)
- 3.8L V6 Buick 3800 L27 NA
- GM THM700R4 / 4L40 4 Speed Automatic Transmission


## Future Notes:
Given more time and money, I would like to swap the engine to the toyota 2GR-FE.
The 2GR is plentiful in Australia, significantly lighter, more powerful and more efficent.
But in order to do that, I would need to go to a high-end standalone ECU to allow for tuning, machine a transmission adaptor, fabricate a custom sump and all engine mounting.

A much more likely swap would be to the Series 2 Buick 3800 L36 or L67.
These have better aftermarket options for power, are lighter and more powerful than the Series 1.
They also have an improved ECU that can be tuned.



## To Do:
- Install lower ratio diff
- Finish new Gauge Cluster
