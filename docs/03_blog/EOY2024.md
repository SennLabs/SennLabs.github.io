2024 has been a big year for increase in hardware and compute as I have been working on getting my startup off the ground.
Both my homelab and the startup's gear are in this roundup.
I have had a focus on allowing for remote access and system redundancy. I still need to work on some of this going into Q1 of 2025.

### Primary Workstation
Specs:
- Intel i5-12600K
- 64 GB DDR4
- 2 TB WD 
- MSI RTX 3090 Suprim X

This PC has seen several GPU's this year.
It began the year with a GTX 1080Ti, but I was constantly maxing it out both in games and when training machine learning models.
In April, I upgraded to a Gigabyte RTX 2080Ti OC. The performance gains for gaming wasn't spectacular. But the speed increase for training and running models was incredible.
It wasn't long until I was getting sick of the maxing out the 11GB of VRAM. So In September I ordered a MSI RTX 3090 Suprim X, this was the most expensive computer component I has purchased. But the performance increase from it was well worth it.
I don't see this PC getting much more upgraded in it for the time being, It meets most of what I need of it, and anything else would be requiring going to a processor with more PCIE Lanes, and would be better off as a server.


### Primary Laptop
- Surface Laptop (1st Gen)
- Intel i5-7200U
- 8GB DDR4
- 250GB SSD

My surface has lasted me ~6 years, but the hinge failed in November. This causes the laptop to be closed or completely open, essentially 180deg.
As a crutch until I decide on and order a replacement, I have 3D printed a brace that holds it at a usable angle.
I am planning to have this mounted in someway to my desk set up once I get my replacement.


### Primary NAS
- Intel i5-4570
- 32 GB DDR3
- 240GB WD Green SSD
- 240GB Crucial BX500 SSD
- 2x 4 TB Seagate IronWolf ST4000VN006-3CW104
- 2x 10 TB Seagate ST10000NM0046

This NAS has been working completely fine and I haven't really had to touch it.
But going into 2025, I will be splitting it into 2 systems, One for my family's photos, docs, movies, and one for all my files.
