It began the year with a GTX 1080Ti, but I was constantly maxing it out both in games and when training machine learning models. In April, I upgraded to a Gigabyte RTX 2080Ti OC. The performance gains for gaming wasn't spectacular. But the speed increase for training and running models was incredible. It wasn't long until I was getting sick of the maxing out the 11GB of VRAM. So In September I ordered a MSI RTX 3090 Suprim X, this was the most expensive computer component I has purchased. But the performance increase from it was well worth it. I don't see this PC getting much more upgraded in it for the time being, It meets most of what I need of it, and anything else would be requiring going to a processor with more PCIE Lanes, and would be better off as a server.</p>","tags":["Server","Homelab"]},{"location":"blog/EOY2024/#primary-laptop","title":"Primary Laptop","text":"<ul> <li>Surface Laptop (1st Gen)</li> <li>Intel i5-7200U</li> <li>8GB DDR4</li> <li>250GB SSD</li> </ul> <p>My surface has lasted me ~6 years, but the hinge failed in November.
